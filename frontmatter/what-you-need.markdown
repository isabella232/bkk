[TODO: FPE - Fill in this page with all the technology prerequisites the reader needs, to follow the book.

This usually contains:

* **Programming language**: The version of the language you'll use to write the code. E.g. Kotlin 1.4 or Swift 5.
* **IDE / Code Editor**: The name and version of the development environment you'll write your code in. E.g. Android Studio 4.2.
* **Platform**: The platform version you'll target or the minimum OS version on test devices and emulators. It's best to target the very minimum and let readers use what they have. E.g. Android 5.1+ (API 21+).
* **Framework**: If your topic is targeting a specific framework, like Jetpack Compose or RxSwift, specify the minimum version the reader needs to follow the content. E.g. Jetpack Compose Beta02, RxSwift 6.1.

You should follow the format above, where you make a bulleted list with the term in bold, and then a description of why it is required.

There may be more items you need than in the list above. Make sure to list out everything the users need to follow your book, to make it easier for them to set up their tools!]

# What You Need

To follow along with this book, you'll need the following:

* **Technology One**: Fill out what the reader needs; a certain OS version, a certain IDE version, etc.

* **Technology Two**: Fill out what the reader needs; a certain OS version, a certain IDE version, etc.

# Example

To follow along with this book, you'll need the following:

* **Kotlin 1.4**: Since Jetpack Compose relies on a special Kotlin compiler, you need Kotlin 1.4 both to write the code and for the compiler to process special Jetpack Compose annotations.
* **Android Studio Canary**: Jetpack Compose is still in its infancy, in an alpha version, and you need to use bleeding edge versions of Android Studio to use it. Currently, that’s an Android Studio Canary build — the Arctic Fox release.
* **Android 5.1+**: The `minimumSdkVersion` for the projects targets API 21, so you need a device or an emulator running API 21 or higher.
* **Jetpack Compose Beta 2 or greater**: This is the Jetpack Compose version you’ll use in the book, and it represents one of the latest versions out there. But because Jetpack Compose is updated every few weeks, there might be a newer version available by the time you read this. We suggest following the book and using the projects with the version we used. You can always explore newer versions of the toolkit, but you might have to apply different migrations to the code. After all, things change frequently in alpha versions!
